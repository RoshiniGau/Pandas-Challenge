# **PyCitySchools**

## Analyzing the district-wide standardized test results,every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Below is an aggregated data to and showcased the obvious trends in school performance.

## **PyCity School Analysis**

1. School that spend 585-615 dollars per student have a better percent passing reading,percent passing math and percent overall
passing rate than schools that spend more than 615 dollars per student. 

2. It is found that schools with 2000 students or less have a higher percent passing reading ,percent passing math, and percent
overall passing rate than larger schools that have 2000 â€“ 5000 students. Furthermore, the smaller the school, the less they spend per student.

3. Charter schools have a higher percent passing reading, percent passing math, and percent overall passing rate than District schools. 
Thus being the top five performing schools based on percent passing rates, whereas the bottom five performing schools based on percent passing rate are District schools.
